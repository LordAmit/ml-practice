# Data Pre-Processing

*Disclaimer: Still learning, should not be used as reference/guidance*

- Data should not contain missing data
- If it does, fill it somehow (median / mean .. )
- Categorical data should be represented as nominal data
- Data should be split to training and test set. Generally ratio is 8:2, sometimes around 6:4.
- Without proper training, it may start overfitting.
- For getting better correlation, features should be scaled (normalization/standardization/some other algorithm).
